# libuv.js

v8 bindings for libuv. Mad science and experimentation.

If you don't know anything about c++ or v8 bindings this module is not for you.

## overview

Read the following files:

* src/uvjs.h
* lib/uv.js
* test/index.js

## run tests

```shell
make test
```

## why?

No opinions. No module system. No extra API. Just bindings to libuv for javascript. Build your own node.js like environment and make your own API sugar.

## documentation

There is none.

## I'm scared

You should be.

## credits

Some of the code is copied from the node.js, libuv, v8, and [nan](https://github.com/rvagg/nan) projects. Some of this will change as this project is cleaned up and made more mature.
